About: I used Python Scrapy in the creation of this project. Scrapy is a Python framework for large scale web scraping. It gives you all the tools you need to efficiently extract data from websites, process them as you want, and store them in your preferred structure and format. 

To Do:

- Write data to excel file
- Compare prices from previous prices
- Send email to my gmail if the price has dropped below a certain number


To Run use command -> scrapy crawl amazon_spider
